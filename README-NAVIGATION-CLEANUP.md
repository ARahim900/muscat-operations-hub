# Navigation Cleanup Complete ✅

This repository has been cleaned up to remove the modern navigation components that were created today and reverted to the original clean sidebar design.

## Files Removed:
- `src/components/layout/modern-sidebar.tsx` - Complex gradient sidebar 
- `src/components/layout/modern-navbar.tsx` - Top navigation bar
- `src/components/layout/modern-app-shell.tsx` - Modern navigation wrapper

## Current Navigation:
- `src/components/layout/app-shell.tsx` - Original clean sidebar (active)
- Uses shadcn/ui components for clean, minimal design
- Matches the sidebar shown in the provided screenshot

## Layout Status:
- ✅ Layout reverted to use original `AppShell`
- ✅ Clean minimal sidebar navigation active
- ✅ All modern navigation files removed
- ✅ Repository matches yesterday's design

Your Muscat Bay Operations Hub now has the exact navigation from your screenshot!
